// React elements have different attributes compares to their HTML counterparts. Since JSX is still javascript, we use camelcase.
// Also, class is a protected keyword in javascript (creating classes) so the HTML class attribute in JSX is className.

<div className="my-container">
	<img className="my-container-image" src="my-image.jpeg"/>
</div>
